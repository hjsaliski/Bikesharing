The Purpose of this Challenge was to take a text file(CSV) and upload it into Tableau to make data visualizations on specific questions that we were looking for within this challenge. We needed to take the csv file into jupyter notebook and change the data filters to add a datetime function for the file. We then took an updated csv file and used that to make our visualizations in Tableau. We then looked for specific data within this csv file and created graphs and tables to help explain that data in easier to read terms. Each of these screenshots explains the certain criteria that we were looking for,.

For this part of the challenge we wanted to find checkout times by users.

For this part we acted upon this checkout time by users and added a filter for genders within the checkout times.
